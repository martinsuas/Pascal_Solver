# Pascal_Solver
Solves a generalized pascal triangle by coordinating threads.

A generalized Pascal triangle defines the starting point of the tip, the
offset to the leftmost number in a row, and the offset to the rightmost
number in a row.

Usage: GenPasTri N A B S

N = Number of rows
A = Leftmost offset
B = Rightmost offset
S = Starting number (topmost point of the triangle)
